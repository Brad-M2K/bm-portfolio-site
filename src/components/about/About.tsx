            I’ve always been curious about how things work — and how they can be made better. But for a
            long time, life took me down a different path. Living with cystic fibrosis meant fighting just to
            stay stable, and when Kaftrio gave me a second chance at life, I felt I owed it to myself to build
            something lasting.

            In 2022, I began working in elderly care and quickly moved up to a Duty Manager role in a
            retirement living development. It was demanding but meaningful work that taught me leadership,
            empathy, and resilience. By 2024, I wanted a new challenge — something that reminded me less of
            my own health battles — so I moved into children’s residential care to make a difference earlier in
            people’s lives. After taking some time out to reset and refocus, I decided to finally pursue what had
            been in the back of my mind for years.

            That’s what led me to coding. I joined Northcoders in 2025 after years of wanting to take the leap,
            and since then, I’ve been learning to build full-stack web apps from the ground up. I’m still early
            in my journey, but I’m all in — driven by curiosity, progress, and the chance to make a career
            doing something that truly inspires me.
